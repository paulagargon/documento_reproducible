	abstract = {1. Impacts of global change on the distribution, abundance, and phenology of species have been widely documented. In particular, recent climate change has led to widespread changes in animal and plant seasonality, leading to debate about its potential to cause phenological mismatches among interacting taxa.
            2. In mountainous regions, populations of many species show pronounced phenological gradients over short geographic distances, presenting the opportunity to test for effects of climate on phenology, independent of variation in confounding factors such as photoperiod.
            3. Here we show for 32 butterfly species sampled for five years over a 1700 m gradient (560–2260 m) in a Mediterranean mountain range that, on average, annual flight period is delayed with elevation by 15–22 days per kilometre. Species mainly occurring at low elevations in the region, and to some extent those flying earlier in the year, showed phenological delays of 23–36 days per kilometre, whereas the flight periods of species that occupy high elevations, or fly in late summer, were consistently more synchronised over the elevation gradient.
            4. Elevational patterns in phenology appear to reflect a narrowing phenological window of opportunity for larval and adult butterfly activity of high elevation and late‐flying species.
            5. Here, we speculate as to the causes of these patterns, and the consequences for our ability to predict species responses to climate change. Our results raise questions about the use of space–time substitutions in predicting phenological responses to climate change, since traits relating to flight period and environmental associations may influence the capacity of species to adapt to changing climates.},

            Inferring species' responses to climate change in the absence of long‐term time series data is a challenge, but can be achieved by substituting space for time. For example, thermal elevational gradients represent suitable proxies to study phenological responses to warming. We used butterfly data from two Mediterranean mountain areas to test whether mean dates of appearance of communities and individual species show a delay with increasing altitude, and an accompanying shortening in the duration of flight periods. We found a 14‐day delay in the mean date of appearance per kilometer increase in altitude for butterfly communities overall, and an average 23‐day shift for 26 selected species, alongside average summer temperature lapse rates of 3°C per km. At higher elevations, there was a shortening of the flight period for the community of 3 days/km, with an 8.8‐day average decline per km for individual species. Rates of phenological delay differed significantly between the two mountain ranges, although this did not seem to result from the respective temperature lapse rates. These results suggest that climate warming could lead to advanced and lengthened flight periods for Mediterranean mountain butterfly communities. However, although multivoltine species showed the expected response of delayed and shortened flight periods at higher elevations, univoltine species showed more pronounced delays in terms of species appearance. Hence, while projections of overall community responses to climate change may benefit from space‐for‐time substitutions, understanding species‐specific responses to local features of habitat and climate may be needed to accurately predict the effects of climate change on phenology.},

	abstract = {An analysis is made of the floristic richness of the Sierra Nevada (southern Spain), where more than 2100 vascular plants were catalogued, thus making it the area with the richest and most varied flora in the western Mediterranean region, including a considerable number of endemic species. In a study of the endangered flora and its protection, 116 taxa are listed as having the most restricted distribution and as being under threat of extinction. Field work for these taxa was undertaken in order to improve knowledge of their habitats, populations, chorology and main threats. Using the new IUCN categories of threat, an analysis was made for each of the taxa, especially those that are critically endangered with a very low number of individuals or very narrow areas of occupancy. Mention is made of the problems posed by the practical application of the new IUCN categories. The main types of environmental impact affecting the flora are also described, including grazing, natural causes, wetland desiccation and water pollution. The highest-lying areas (oro- and cryoro-Mediterranean belts) are where most of the threatened plants are to be found. Since these same plants are mostly endemic to the Sierra Nevada, the need to protect the high peaks of the area is paramount. Reference is made to current legislation protecting threatened plants and the gaps in the European Union Habitats Directive with relevance to the protection of the Sierra Nevada flora. A number of key strategies for protection are proposed.},

	abstract = {In this paper we review the 169 species or subspecies of arthropods previously considered endemic to the Sierra Nevada and update their status. To do so, we have reviewed all the existing literature on each taxon, from the original article in which it is described to any other article where its taxonomy and distribution is updated. We have also looked for information on possible endemic species or subspecies that may have been overlooked in the initial list, or that may have been described later.
We considered four categories: 1) endemic, in the strict sense, those known only from the Sierra Nevada massif, 2) subendemic, occurring in one or two massifs or areas in addition to Sierra Nevada, 3) non-endemic, species that were considered endemic but live in three or more massifs or others areas, in addition to Sierra Nevada, and 4) not present, those that were erroneously cited as endemic to this massif but whose distribution does not include, either in the past or at present, Sierra Nevada. 
As a result, we have reviewed the status of 198 species and subspecies, of which 147 are endemic in the strict sense, 35 subendemic, 13 non-endemic and 3 not present. We also highlight the presence of 6 genera that are monospecific and exclusive to Sierra Nevada. Also, as a consequence of the extensive bibliographical revision, some of the dates of description or the names of some taxa have been modified. Finally, we highlight some species described from Sierra Nevada but which have not been found since their description, especially the case of the tettigonid Sabaterpia paulinoi (Bolívar, 1877) which we consider as possibly extinct.},
